Python

For linting, testing and building a pipeline with python. I would use a combination of packages depending on the part of project that needs to be tested. 

For linting, some of the option are: -
Pylint,
PyFlakes,
PyCodestyle, 
Pydocstyle 

Out of them, pylint be my choice of tool. It analyses the code without actually running it on a server. This can be done by predefining the parameters meaning finding errors in code standards and general errors like tab space after each line.

For Testing, some of the options are: -
PyUnit/UnitTest
Python Robot Framework, 
PyTest, 
Python Behave

Out of them, pyUnit will be my choice of tool. It easy to use, doesn't need addition modules to work, easy to build and run test cases.

For Building

PyBuilder is a powerfull python build tool



Alternative of Jenkins and github for CI are: -
GitLab,
Bamboo for Atlassian Jira,
JFrog ,
Spinnaker,
Teamcity

They are good CI host, choice is done on based of other project preferences and application requirements. 


Factors affecting the decision of using self-hosted or clouds based host are: -
Size of the applicaiton
Requirement of graphic card in the application
Budget
